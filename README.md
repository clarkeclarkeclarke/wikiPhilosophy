# wikiPhilosophy
A code challenge I recieved for a job interview. The program must take a Wikipedia page as input and open the first link on each page until it reaches the Philosophy page.


The Wikipedia parser program can be found in examples/Wikipedia.
I downloaded the Jsoup library to help me with this program and it is very straightforward to use.
I've encountered a problem where a few pages loop between each other and I'm working on adding an attribute to each link to show if it's been 
visited or not.
